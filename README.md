# BlynkyHome
BlynkyHome is my funproject to play with NODEMCU/ESP8266, Blynk, a bunch of sensors and a KaKu (Klik aan Klik uit) system. It delivers automatic control of the lights in the livingroom. Automatic push notification when someone enters the room and information + logging of the temperature, barometric pressure, humidity and ambient light intensity.

It can use the newe KaKu protocol (which is much more reliable, if you ask me).

More to come!!
