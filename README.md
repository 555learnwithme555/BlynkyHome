# BlynkyHome
BlynkyHome is my funproject to play with NODEMCU/ESP8266, Blynk (a wonderfull kickstarter project), Thingspeak, a bunch of sensors and a KaKu (Klik aan Klik uit) system. It delivers automatic control of the lights in the livingroom. Automatic push notification when someone enters the room and information + logging of the temperature, barometric pressure, humidity and ambient light intensity.

It can use the new KaKu protocol (which is much more reliable, if you ask me).

Components I am using now:
- NodeMCU 1.0 (new version)
- DHT22 (humidity sensor)
- GY-65 (BMP085, barometric sensor)
- DS18B20 (temperature sensor)
- LDR
- PIR motion detection sensor
- 433Mhz transmitter

Designed and ordered a PCB to make everything nice. :-)

More to come!!
